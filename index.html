<!-- This HTML file provides a simple example of a portfolio page. It contains a header, a few sections, and a few charts. -->
<!-- It works with the three css files in this folder: example1.css, example2.css and example3.css. -->
<!-- The HTML file defines the structure of the page, and the CSS files define how it looks. -->
<!-- The CSS examples are all designed to work with this page. Try swapping them out on line 29 and see what happens. -->

    <!-- HTML is heirarchial: tags like this define elements on the page. 
    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair
    -->

<head>    
    <!-- The head tag links to resources our page needs and defines information about it. Tags in the <head> aren't displayed on the page. -->

    <!-- This is a link to a stylesheet which contains rules about how each element on the page should be defined-->
    <!-- Try swapping example1.css to another, and take a look at example1.css to see if you understand it-->
