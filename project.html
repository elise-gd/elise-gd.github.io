                Over the last 100 years, the world's GDP has risen steadily as we can see in this first chart. This increase has led to a rise in the overall standard of living of the population, with better living conditions. GDP can be defined in several ways: as the sum of income, production or expenditure. This indicator is often used to analyse the well-being of the population by suggesting a link between a country's level of income and its level of happiness. Is GDP enough to draw conclusions about people's happiness? And if so, does money make happiness?

    The data analysis and analytical challenges
</h4>

        <p>
        The data used for this study comes from the World Report Happiness and the World Bank. The data has been cleaned to extract the variables used in this analysis (e.g. happiness index variables, GDP per capita) and make them manipulable to build these visualisations.
        </p>
        <p>
      Let's look at the general trends. These world maps show the countries with the highest GDP levels and the countries with the highest happiness scores. Similar colours are used to show the similarity of these two world maps, whether we look at happiness levels or GDP. In order to make it clearer, categories of GDP and of Happiness index have been created. Given that the GDP data and the happiness index data do not come from the same source, it was crucial to clean up the data so that the two maps covered the same countries. The interactivity of the two maps makes it easier to compare the data.

    <p>
      We can see similarities between the wealthiest countries and the happiest ones. For example, european countries have relatively high levels of GDP but also high levels of happiness. On the other hand, African countries have for the most low levels of GDP and Happiness.Therefore, GDP could be use as an indicator that reflects people's happiness. But is it enough? These two representations have similarities but many far from identical. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We will use two countries with similar levels of GDP as examples to show that, at first glance, GDP can be used to represent the happiness of different countries in the world, but that in reality it is only a quantitative index that lacks the qualitative dimension needed to represent happiness. To conduct this analysis, data from Russia and Canada were extracted from the initial database.

        We can look closer at the different trends of GDP and Happiness Score from 2016 to 2022 in order to show that even with relatively similar GDP levels, the happiness score can be different.

    </script>
    
<p>
    GDP's trend of those two countries is close and is around the same levels. However, the happiness index is, on this period, always almost 2 points higher in Canada. This shows us that there are other variables influencing the happiness of countries aside from money. Let's take a look at the calculation methods of the index to understand the difference of happiness levels between those two countries. We'll look at 2022 data.

</script>

<p>
    Data from the World Happiness Report were sorted to use only the values of Russia and Canada. We can see that the GDP has a big part in the total of the index. However, the difference between Russia and Canada can be explain thanks to other variables such as the freedom to make life choices or the perception of corruption.

    Looking at this example, we see that happiness is also due to the life conditions of each countries. In this example, some variables have more impact than other. Let's make a correlation analysis to undertand which variables tends to have more weight than others.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look closer at the 6 dimensions of the happiness index. Does every variable has the same weight in the purchase of a high happiness score ? To conduct this analysis, data from every country of the world were used. This chart was made interactive to distinguish each countries out of the scatterplot.

    figures.forEach(fig => {

      autosize: { type: 'fit', contains: 'padding' } // Fait remplir le conteneur
    }).catch(console.error);
  });

</script>

  <p> 
    We can see that variables such as Social Support or Freedom to make Life choices have a strong role in the level of the happiness index but variable such as Generosity doesn't play a huge role.

<h4>
    Conclusions
</h4>

<p>
Money (i.e. GDP) is partly responsible for countries' level of happiness. It is one of the factors explaining individual satisfaction. However, on its own, it is insufficient to draw conclusions, as happiness is above all a qualitative indicator. This analysis makes a lot of sense to me because, in my opinion, incorporating the notion of well-being and happiness is a way forward for economic research and is essential in the development of economic policies, whether national or global.
