        Does money make happiness ?

                Over the last 100 years, the world's GDP has risen steadily. This increase has led to a rise in the overall standard of living of the population, with better living conditions. GDP can be calculated in several ways: as the sum of income, production or expenditure. This tool is often used to analyse the well-being of the population by suggesting a link between a country's level of income and its level of happiness. Is GDP enough to draw conclusions about people's happiness? And if so, does money make happiness?

      To begin this analysis, let's look at the general trends. These world maps show the countries with the highest GDP levels and the countries with the highest happiness scores. Similar colours are used to show the similarity of these two world maps, whether we look at GDP or happiness levels.

      We can therefore conclude that GDP is an indicator that reflects people's happiness. But is it enough? Although these two representations are similar, they are not exactly the same. In what way is GDP a necessary but insufficient indicator for measuring people's happiness?
