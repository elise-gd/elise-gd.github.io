        Does money make happiness ?

                Over the last 100 years, the world's GDP has risen steadily. This increase has led to a rise in the overall standard of living of the population, with better living conditions. GDP can be calculated in several ways: as the sum of income, production or expenditure. This tool is often used to analyse the well-being of the population by suggesting a link between a country's level of income and its level of happiness. Is GDP enough to draw conclusions about people's happiness? And if so, does money make happiness?

      To begin this analysis, let's look at the general trends. These world maps show the countries with the highest GDP levels and the countries with the highest happiness scores. Similar colours are used to show the similarity of these two world maps, whether we look at happiness levels or GDP.

    <p>
      We can see similarities between the wealthiest countries and the happiest ones. For example, european countries have relatively high levels of GDP but also high levels of happiness. On the other hand, African countries have for the most low levels of GDP and Happiness.Therefore, GDP could be use as an indicator that reflects people's happiness. But is it enough? These two representations have similarities but many far from identical. To what extend is GDP a necessary variable but insufficient one on its own to measure people's happiness?
    </p>

    <p>
        We will use two countries with similar levels of GDP as examples to show that, at first glance, GDP can be used to represent the happiness of different countries in the world, but that in reality it is only a quantitative index that lacks the qualitative dimension needed to represent happiness.

        As we see on the worlds maps, Canada and Russia have the same GDP per capita in 2022, however, their happiness indexes aren’t quite similar, with 7 points for Canada and 5,4 for Russia. We can look closer at the different trends of GDP and Happiness Score from 2016 to 2022 in order to show that even with similar GDP levels, the happiness score can be different.

<p>
    As for the data of 2022, we can see that the GDP's trend of those two countries is close and is around the same levels. However, the happiness index is, on this period, always almost 2 points higher in Canada. This shows us that there are other variables influencing the happiness of countries aside from money. Let's take a look at the calculation methods of the index to understand the difference of happiness levels between those two countries. We'll look at 2022 data.

    vegaEmbed("#Location6",figure_6)
</script>

<p>
    We can see that the GDP has a big part in the total of the index. However, the difference between Russia and Canada can be explain thanks to other variables such as the freedom to make life choices or the perception of corruption.

    Looking at this example, we see that happiness is also due to the life conditions of each countries. In this example, some variables have more impact than other. Let's look at some econometric analysis to undertand which variables tends to have more weight than others.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look closer at the 6 dimensions of the happiness index. Does every variable has the same weight in the purchase of a high happiness score ?

    ];
  
    figures.forEach(fig => {
      vegaEmbed(`#${fig.id}`, fig.url, {width: 200, height: 200}).catch(console.error);
    });
  </script>

  <p> 
    We can see that variables such as Social Support or Freedom to make Life choices have a strong role in the level of the happiness index but variable such as Generosity doesn't play a huge role.

        Data from the World Bank and the World Happiness Record were used to create this work. The entire analysis refers to the year 2022.
